            <p class="explanation">The illustration conveys the life of a student, mainly a Montalbeño student. The image, either-or painted canvas, depicts most students' struggles and circumstances, just like the following;</p>
            <ul class="explanation">
                <li>High fare cost</li>
                <li>Traffic</li>
                <li>Air pollution, land pollution, water pollution, etc. </li>
                    
            </ul>
            <p class="explanation1">These circumstances are due to the modifications that occur in our generation; some say that it is an unfathomable and inevitable change that we must bare. Furthermore, the illustration depicts that we must be resilient because life is full of ups and downs; we must be capable of withstanding unforeseen challenges. As trials and challenges continue to oppugn us, we must have the courage and the fortitude to keep moving forward and to transform those into opportunities. Lastly, always keeping our feet on the ground is also a golden rule - being humble, in simple terms. Despite different social statuses, all social classes must be appreciated, respected, and treated fairly; we are just surviving and dealing with the things only we can comprehend the most.</p>

        <p>Oooh! What a tiring day<br>
            It feels like I have been beaten by a ray<br>
            You know, I have a lot to say<br>
            With all the happenings that we encountered today.<br><br>
            
            It started with the cost of the fare<br>
            That is a whole lot different from the past ages when we compare,<br>
            Those commuters will be most likely scared<br>
            To this change we come unprepared.<br><br>
            
            Pollution in the air<br>
            That goes all over my hair<br>
            Makes me think if our town is in despair<br>
            Because of the amount of creature pollution has been impaired.<br><br>
            
            It is rewarding to visit a remote place<br>
            Where people move along at their own pace<br>
            We have seen how hard it for it to replace<br>
            The simplicity, joy, and peace that they embrace.<br><br>
            
            However, life there is poor<br>
            Kids forced to work and endure<br>
            That kind of lifestyle for their living to sustain<br>
            Even if they want to complain.<br><br>
            
            Truly, morning til night<br>
            Traffic is at sight<br>
            Where commuters are all uptight<br>
            Because of the blinking red lights.<br><br>
            
            Nevertheless, we need to fight<br>
            We have to exert more courage and might<br>
            To diminish people's fright<br>
            Of being late and bothered spright.<br><br>
            
            The day is so thrilling,<br>
            Yet fulfilling<br>
            In the end, I just want to say that I have one question in mind<br>
            It is... How can we make this right?</p>
